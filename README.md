# Dialogue-Node-System
The prototype of a Dialogue Node System realized in Unity 2021.1.11.

## Core features

1. Multiple nodes available:
  - CharacterNode and RepliqueNode (to add characters and text lines as well as audio),
  - Support for branching dialogues (BranchNode for logic, ChoiceNode for multiple answers, conditional StartNodes to start the dialogue at different points),
  - Support for sortable event callbacks with the EventNode,
2. Flexible save system with .CSV files,
3. Ability to write dialogue in multiple langugages
4. A demo example scene.

Future updates will include :

1. More settings for the Replique Node (append text insted of overriding it, set delay between characters)
2. Addition of BackgroundNode to add 2D textures as background and fade,
3. Ability to add and remove languages directly in the editor window,
4. Copy/Paste/Duplicate ability,
5. Add nodes from another Dialogue by dragging its asset into the editor window.
